    "detailedDescription": "Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam is a Hindu temple situated on the Simhachalam Hill Range, which is 300 metres above the sea level in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple's legend, Vishnu manifested in this form (lion's head and human body) after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu. Except on Akshaya Trutiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a linga.\nSimhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and others. The earliest inscription at the temple belongs to 11th-century CE recording the gift by a private individual in the era of Chalukya Chola king Kulottunga I. In the later half of the 13th century, the temple complex underwent radical physical changes during the reign of the Eastern Ganga king Narasimhadeva I. Narahari Tirtha, a Dvaita philosopher and Eastern Ganga minister converted the Simhachalam temple into an educational establishment of renown and a religious centre for Vaishnavism. It later received patronage from many royal families, of which Tuluva dynasty of Vijayanagara Empire is a notable one. The temple underwent 40 years of religious inactivity from 1564 to 1604 CE. In 1949, the temple came under the purview of the state government and is currently administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam Board.\nSimhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three outer courtyards and five gateways. The architecture is a mixture of the styles of the Kalinga Architecture, Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, and the Cholas. The temple faces west instead of east, signifying victory. There are two temple tanks: Swami Pushkarini near the temple and Gangadhara at the bottom of the hill. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams. The religious practices and customs of the temple are formulated by the Vaishnavite philosopher Ramanuja. They are modelled based on the Satvata Samhita, one of the 108 texts of the Pancharatra Agama.\nSimhachalam is the second-largest temple, after Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, in terms of income earned. Devotees believe that the deity is capable of giving progeny to women and fulfilling the wishes of devotees. Kalyanotsava and Chandanotsava are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple, followed by Narasimha Jayanti, Navaratrotsava and Kamadahana. The festivals celebrated in Simhachalam have an influence of the Dravida Sampradaya. Apart from those by well-known poets, the temple is found in many literary references and lyrical works (dedicated by anonymous writers), which are preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "Srikurmam Kurmanathaswamy Temple (also known as Srikurmam temple) is a Hindu temple in the Gara mandal of the Srikakulam district in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to the Kurma avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, who is worshipped as Kurmanathaswamy, and his consort Lakshmi, worshipped as Kurmanayaki. According to Hindu legend, the presiding deity is believed to have manifested here in the form of a tortoise-shaped deity. Brahma then consecrated the deity with Gopala Yantra. The temple is famous for ancestor worship.\nSrikurmam is the only Indian temple in the world where Vishnu is worshiped in his Kurma avatar. Initially dedicated to Shiva and referred to as Kurmeswara temple, Ramanuja is said to have converted Srikurmam into a Vaishnavite temple in the 11th\u00a0century CE. Since then, the temple was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Simhachalam. Later Naraharitirtha, a disciple of Madhvacharya, was instrumental in making Srikurmam the seat of Vishnavite religious activities. The temple has two dhvajasthambas, a rarity for a Vaishnavite temple. 108 ekasila (single-stone) pillars, with none resembling each other, bear few inscriptions related to the royal lineages that existed in this area in the past. A tortoise park has been built to conserve the adult and young star tortoises, making Srikurmam the only conservation centre for this species.\nSrikurmam follows both Shaivite and Vaishnavite traditions of worship. Four daily rituals and four annual festivals are celebrated in Srikurmam, out of which the three-day Dolotsavam is the major one. Gajapathi Rajus of Vizianagaram are the trustees of the temple, which is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The Indian postal department issued a stamp featuring the temple on 11\u00a0April 2013.\n",

The Kalika Purana composed in the 11th century CE in Kamarupa talks about the origin of this form of Vishnu and his final establishment in the hill of Monikut, where the present temple is located.  The present temple structure was constructed by the King Raghudeva Narayan in 1583. According to some historians the King of Pala dynasty constructed it in 10th century. It is a stone temple and it enshrines an image of Hayagriva Madhava. Some Buddhists believe that the Hayagriva Madhava temple, best known in the group of Hindu temples, is where the Buddha attained Nirvana. At this imposing temple, the presiding deity is Vishnu, worshipped in the sanctum sanctorum as an idol carved of black stone. Four other stone idols are also in worship as subsidiary deities. \n\nA most striking feature of the temple is the continuous row of elephants carved on the lowest level of the temple walls - a structure akin to the stone cut temple of Ellora. The outer walls of the shrine is also covered with relief figures of the ten incarnations of Vishnu, devotees in procession and episodic scenes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. There is a big pond known as Madhab Pukhuri near the temple. Doul, Bihu and Janmastami festivals are celebrated every year in the temple. \n\nSayani, the first wife of Kalia Bhomora Borphukan donated a family of paiks and also a plot of land for their maintenance to the Hayagriva Madhava temple during the reign of Ahom king Kamaleswar Singha. The lamps in the sanctum sancotrum are never put off (akhanda deep) ever. Oil flows into the big earthen lamps through a simple tube connected to the oil tin.\n",

Among these, Tripurasundari, Matangi and Kamala reside inside the main temple whereas the other seven reside in individual temples. It is an important pilgrimage destination for Hindus and especially for Tantric worshipers.\nOriginally an autochthonous place of worship, the Kamakya Temple became identified with the state power when the Mleccha and then with the Pala kings of Kamarupa, and finally the Koch and the Ahoms patronised it.  The Kalika Purana, written during the Pala rule, connected Naraka, the legitimizing progenitor of the Kamarupa kings, with the myth of the goddess Kamakhya representing the region and Kamarupa kingdom.\nIn July 2015, the Supreme Court of India transferred the administration of the Temple from the Kamakhya Debutter Board to the Bordeuri Samaj.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "The Mundeshwari Devi Temple (also spelled as Mundesvari) is located at paunra pahad, Ramgarh village in Kaimur district in the state of Bihar, India on the Mundeshwari Hills. It is an ancient temple dedicated to the worship of Lord Shiva and Shakti and is considered one of the oldest Hindu temples in India. It is also considered as the oldest functional Hindu temple of India.\nThe information plaque erected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at the site indicates the dating of the temple to 625 CE. Hindu inscriptions dated 635 CE were found in the temple. The temple is a protected monument under ASI since 1915. Local folklores say that Chanda and Munda who were full brothers and chieftains of demon Mahishasura were rulers of the area. Mahishasura fought decisive battle with Gooddess Durga as mentioned in Durga Shaptshati. Munda made goddess Mundeshwari Bhawani temple while his younger brother Chanda made Chandeshwari temple at top of Madurana hill near Chainpur.\nBut historical facts better explain its origin and its creators. After a study of broken Mundeshwari inscription of Brahmi script and its two parts found in 1891 and 1903 by Bloch (Now joined and kept in National Museum, Kolkata), Dr NG Majumdar and Dr KC Panigrahi stated to be the temple to be earlier than 4th century AD.\nBut recovery of a royal seal of great Sri Lankan emperor Maharaju Dutthagamani (101-77BC) from the place in 2003, changed the history. It established that a royal pilgrims group or monks from Shri Lanka visited the place during their journey to Sarnath from Bodh Gaya through famous Dakshinapath highway sometime between 101BC to 77BC and lost the seal here.\nThe existence of Naga (serpent) on four faced shivalingam, Naga janeu (sacred thread) on Ganesha idols not found anywhere in India and also on broken pieces scattered around the hill clearly indicated that it was a construction by rulers of Naga dynasty (110BC to 315AD) who used serpent as their royal sign.\nMahabharata mentioned that Guru Dronacharya has been made the ruler of Ahikshatra (region of serpents) spread over Ahinaura, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra and Kaimur region of present times, as a fee for educating Kaurava and Pandavas.\nUdaysena, the ruler mentioned in the inscription had similarity with Naga dynasty rulers Nagsen, Veersen etc.\nThe existence of 52 Pur (villages) of Nagvanshi Rajpoots also indicate about their long control over the area.\nLater the area came control of Gupta dynasty and the impact of their specific Nagra style of architecture and Ramgarh Fort and Ramgarh village near the hill probable on famous Gupta ruler Ramgupta are evidence of the fact.\nAfter revelation of new facts, Bihar State Religious Trust Board (BSRTB) organized a national seminar of eminent experts at Patna in 2008 and the date of Mundeshwari inscription was unanimously fixed 108 AD.\nThe findings also established that here was a religious and educational center spread over the hillock and Mandaleshwar (Shiva) temple (present temple residing Shiva in middle of sanctum sanctorium) was the main shrine. The temple of Mandaleshwari (Parvati, better half of Shiva) was on southern side. The temple was damaged and the idol of Mandaleshwari (degenerated Mundeshwari and later connected with the mythical demon Mund) was kept in the eastern chamber of main temple.\n",

The temple is located at Dwarka, Gujarat, India, one of the destinations of Char Dham, a Hindu pilgrimage circuit. The main shrine of the five-storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir. Archaeological findings suggest it to be 2,000 - 2,200 years old. The temple was enlarged in the 15th- 16th century. The Dwarkadhish Temple is a Pushtimarg temple, hence it follows the guidelines and rituals created by Vallabhacharya and Vitheleshnath.\nAccording to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna's grandson, Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place).  The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently rebuilt in the 15th-16th century. The temple became part of the Char Dham pilgrimage considered sacred by Hindus in India. Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher, visited the shrine. The other three being comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath and Puri. Even today a memorial within the temple is dedicated to his visit.

It is a very old temple of Goddess Durga. The main attraction is that the 700 year old idol of the Goddess Durga has 16 Hands (Normally Goddess Durga has 8 Hands). The temple is very old and is currently under renovation. The temple is constructed via the placing of large stones on top of each other without any cementing material. \nAt the temple devotees tie yellow and red sacred threads on bamboo for the fulfilment of their wishes. Upon the fulfillment of their wishes, they again come to the temple and untie the thread. Dedicated to Solha Bhuji Goddess, an avatar of Goddess Durga, Dewri Mandir temple is located a little outside the main city of Ranchi. Spread over nearly two acres, this old temple in Ranchi also houses an idol of Lord Shiva here. Legend has it that whoever has tried to alter the structure of the temple has had to face the wrath of the gods and suffer consequences. Dewri Temple is also believed to be the only temple where six tribal priests, known as Pahans, perform rituals and offer prayers alongside the Brahmin priests. Who are mainly known as Panda's. Located about 60\u00a0km from Ranchi, this temple is on the right side of the Ranchi-Tata road, toward the town of Tamar.\n\n\n",

Completed on December 25, 1691,  it is located about 10\u00a0km from the main town. The temple is on top of a small hillock.\nSimilar to the famous Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, this temple is built in the same architectural style, although smaller. And similar to the Rath Yatra in Puri, an annual fair cum rath yatra is held at this temple in the month of Aashaadha, attracting thousands of tribal and non-tribal devotees not only from Ranchi but also from neighbouring villages and towns and is celebrated with much pomp and vigor.\nThe temple has been built on a hill top. To reach the top visitors can climb the stairs or take the vehicle route. There are many steps and the climber needs to rest intermittently before resuming. People also take the vehicle route leading directly to the top . To facilitate  the arduous climb to the top  the management of the temple have made provisions for fresh water and the shade of a huge tree that many tourists generally make use of once they reach the top. The view of the city from the top is breathtaking.\nThe temple collapsed on 6 August 1990. With the active participation of the then State Government of Bihar, and some devoted patrons the reconstruction of the temple started on 8 February 1992 and has now been fully restored. The temple has regained back its former glory. And devotees and ardent worshippers make a beeline to the temple every year.\n",

It is the largest monument in Halebidu, a town in the state of Karnataka, India and the former capital of the Hoysala Empire. The temple was built on the banks of a large man-made lake, and sponsored by King Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala Empire. Its construction started around 1121 CE and was complete in 1160 CE. During the early 14th century, Halebidu was twice sacked and plundered by the Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate from northern India, and the temple and the capital fell into a state of ruin and neglect. It is 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) from Hassan city and about 210 kilometres (130\u00a0mi) from Bengaluru.\nThe Hoysaleswara temple is a Shaivism tradition monument, yet reverentially includes many themes from Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, as well as images from Jainism. The Hoysaleswara temple is a twin-temple dedicated to Hoysaleswara and Santaleswara Shiva lingas, named after the masculine and feminine aspects, both equal and joined at their transept. It has two Nandi shrines outside, where each seated Nandi face the respective Shiva linga inside. The temple includes a smaller sanctum for the Hindu Sun god Surya. It once had superstructure towers, but no longer and the temple looks flat. The temple faces east, though the monument is presently visited from the north side. Both the main temples and the Nandi shrines are based on a square plan. The temple was carved from soapstone. It is notable for its sculptures, intricate reliefs, detailed friezes as well its history, iconography, inscriptions in North Indian and South Indian scripts. The temple artwork provides a pictorial window into the life and culture in the 12th century South India. About 340 large reliefs depict the Hindu theology and associated legends. Numerous smaller friezes narrate Hindu texts such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana. Some friezes below large reliefs portray its narrative episodes.\nThe artwork in Hoysaleswara temple is damaged but largely intact. Within a few kilometers of the temple are numerous ruins of Hoysala architecture. The temple, along with the nearby Jain Temples and the Kedareshwara temple,as well as the Kesava temple in Belur, have been proposed to be listed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n",

It is known for the ancient temple of the god Nanjundeshwara (another name for the god Shiva, also known as Nanjundeshwara).  The Nanjundeshwara temple is located in the town on the right bank of river Kapila, a tributary of the Kaveri. Nanjangudu is also known as \"Dakshina Prayaga\"  or \"Prayag of South\".\nNanju in Kannada means poison; the name Nanjundeshwara means the \"God who Drank the Poison\" (halahala), a word that has its origins in the legend of the Great Churning of the Ocean of Milk; thus the town got the name 'Nanjangudu' which means \"the abode of the god Nanjundeshwara\".\nThe \"Dodda Yaathre\" festival at Nanjangud by temple attracts thousands of devotees. The festivities in the fair include five colorful chariots that are pulled by devotees on a path called the ratha beedi.Parasurama temple is near to  Nanjundeshwara temple.\nMythology: Nanjungud is mentioned as Sri Garalapuri, in the Shiva Purana. It is said that the legendary holy place is an abode of Lord Shiva in southern India. It is also referred to as Dakshina Kasi. Lord Shiva appeared at the plea of his devotees, the Devas and Sage Narada. \nThe demon Keshi, obtained the boon from Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu, that they shall not be able to kill him. He assumed, with this boon, he is as good as immortal and began troubling the people, the Devas and the Sages. Finally, Sage Narada along with the Devas pleaded Lord Shiva to save everyone. Lord Shiva appeared in Garalapuri Sri Kshetra, (present Nanjungud) and killed The demon Keshi. \nLord Shiva assured his Ansh - a part of his divine Self shall always remain here and bless the humanity. Lord Shiva assured this place shall be a 'papa vinashini' \u2013 remover of sins. Every human praying to Lord Srikanteshwara or Nanjundeshwara (Lord Shiva) of Nanjungud, after bathing in the holy River of Kabini, will be rid of sins and blessed by Lord Shiva. \nSage Parashuram, after beheading his mother as per his father Sage Jamadagni's orders, wanted to undo his sins from \"Mathru Hathya\" - mother's murder. As per the advice of sage Narada, he reached Garalapuri (Nangangud) prayed to Sri Nanjundeshwara Swamy. Lord Shiva appeared and advised Sage Parashuram to build a Mantap and perform pooja to the Shivling. While clearing the shrubs with his Parashu \u2013 axe, unconsciously Sage Parashuram's axe hit the Shivling and the tip of the Shivling began bleeding. Sage Parashuram felt very guilty and said, \"I have committed another unforgivable sin, only by killing myself I shall be relieved from all my sins\", and prepared to kill himself . Lord Shiva appeared and blessed sage Parashuram and told him to apply wet mid upon the Shivling (the mud of Sri Nanjangud has mense healing powers). The shivling stopped bleeding. Lord Shiva advised Sage Parashuram to build the Mantap and continue his Penance. Finally, Lord Shiva blessed sage Parashuram and relieved him from all his sins and blessed him immortality. \nGoddess Parvati, consort of Lord Shiva wanted to visit this holy place. Lord Shiva brought Goddess Parvati to Garalapuri Nangangud, Devi went to the Kabini river and bent down to touch the water. A gem stone bead \u2013 Mani fell off from her crown into the water. Lord Shiva was pleased and declared, \"Devi, until now, the place had my divine blessings and presence, from this moment it shall have your presence, grace and blessings too. It shall also be called as Dakshina Manikarnika Ghat\". \nHistory: \nDuring the reign of King Tippi Sultan, his royal elephant became blind. As per the advice of his minister, Sri Poorniya, Tippi Sultan sent the elephant to the Nanjundeshwara Swamy temple and performed 48 days rituals. On the 48th day, the elephant got back the vision. Tippi Sultan offered the emerald green Shivling as a token of gratitude to Sri Nanjundeshwara Swamy and called Lord Shiva, \"Hakim Nanjunda\" (healer). \nThe temple Gopuram and its extensive exterior was built by Immidi Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar, the King of Mysore.\n",

Thruchherumana Kshetram is also another name by which temple is known. The temple is a special category temple under Malabar Devaswom board.\nThere are two temples in Kottiyoor, one on the western bank of the Vavali river and the other one on the eastern bank of the Bavali river. The shrine on the east bank (Kizhakkeshwaram or Akkare Kottiyoor) is a temporary hermitage (Yaga shrine) opened only during the Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam. The Vadakkeshwaram or Ikkare Kottiyoor (The Thruchherumana Temple) on the western bank of the river is a permanent temple complex like all other temples. It remains closed throughout the year except for the 27 days of Vysakha festival. The temple is situated in a densely forested area amidst a sacred grove that covers about 80 acres. Mythology says that Akkare Kottiyoor, the shrine on the eastern bank of the river, was the location of Daksha Yaga, at the conclusion of which Sati Devi immolated herself and thus committed suicide in this place.\nThe Kottiyoor Perumal Temple was, in its heyday in terms of gold and precious stones, the second-wealthiest Temple in the entire Kerala region (second only to the Padmanabhaswamy Temple which even with its smaller five vaults opened, lays claim to the largest collection of gold and precious stones ever, as well as being the wealthiest place of worship in the world). Kottiyur Perumal's collection of gold and precious stones has been stored since time immemorial in the 'Karimbana Gopuram' of the \"Ikkare Kottiyoor\" Temple. Kottiyoor Perumal also owned over 30,000 acres of forest-lands in Kannur District.\nThe Thruchherumana Temple was built after the Swayambhoo lingam was found; however the exact date of construction of temple is not known; the pilgrimage has been taking place for many centuries.\n",

Principal deity of the temple is Sree Muthappan, whose divinity is presented as a ritualistic theyyam enactment in two versions called  Thiruvappana and Vellattam. According to the local tradition the presiding deity is a manifestation of Lord Shiva.\nVellattam and Thiruvappana are the generic names for two types of ' Theyyam Ketti-aadal ' in the kavu/temples of North Malabar.\nVellattom is a minor version of the ritual enactment where the ornaments, decorations and parapharnelia are minimal thanks to which all actions including vaaythari (speech) is maximum and Attam (dance) will be at its peak. If you compare this level of enactment to the idol of a deity in a temple sanctum which is installed as per sathwic sasthra and vedic rituals, Vellattom is at par with the idol alone without the prabha-mandalam which circles it. A more easier example is the Seeveli ceremony with only the small idol on top of the elephant.\nOn the other hand, Thiruvappana is the full version, with royal regalia and bigger dimension of prabhamandalam. Because the decorations are more and are of binding nature, the action is minimal and sluggish and the uriyaadal (replies to prayers) will be crisp, to the point and predictions will be accurate. To compare, Thiruvappana stands at par with temple idol with the Prabha-mandalam (representing the auric circle) around it and the Seeveli with the big Swarna-Kolam covering the small idol on top of the elephant .\nMuthappan is considered as the manifestation of Lord Shiva himself in Nayattu (hunter) format. The Vellattam which comes initially is Siva himself as the said minimal version. But the Vellattom which comes along with the grand Thiruvappana of Muthappan later on, is the minimal version of Vishnu who according to mythology, comes to Siva's assistance when he started travelling with the poykannu (blindfold) and started suffering serious difficulties to travel and hunt for food.\nRituals of the temple is unique in that it does not follow the Satvic Brahminical form of worship, as in other Hindu temples of Kerala. The main mode of worship is the ritual enactment of both the versions of Muthappan, through a traditional dance known as Muthappan Theyyam. Fish, meat and toddy are the customary offerings to Muthappan. Muthappan Thiruvoppana Mahothsavam is the major festival of the temple, celebrated for three days every year on 19, 20 and 21  of Kumbham (the days correspond to 3, 4  and 5 March).\n",

This temple is known \"DakshinaKashi\"(SouthaKashi).This very ancient pilgrimage center is centered on the ParaBrahma temple (that is dedicated to the Para Brahman (or Param Brahman) or Ohmkaram, the Universal Consciousness), and covers thirty-six acres of land.\nEvery year the Oachira Vrischikam Festival is celebrated during December and January. Oachirakali is a famous ritual performed here during June and it involves mock-fighting in muddy water by traditional martial art experts. And \"Irupathattam onam\" (28 days after Onam) is also celebrated. It is the festival of cattle. In this festival, huge \"Eduppu kala\" (gigantic idols of bull madeof cloth&hay) are made. They are then pulled on giant wheels to the Oachira Temple from the site where they are made. Normally there are around 50 such structures. It is the biggest festival in \"Onattu Kara\" which is an area of a few square miles. Oachirakkali was actually a war exercise performed annually by soldiers of Kayamkulam Raja. Nearby, about 108 Kalaries were in 52 karas up to the beginning of the 20th century. Soldiers belonging to the above Karas met together at Oachira in the Malayalam month of Mithuna every year and performed war-like exercises. This is what is called Oachirakkali. \nWard and Conner, two British officials entrusted to survey of Travancore in the beginning of the 19th century, made their observations about Oachira in their report. In the report it was made clear that there was a very old and damaged temple on the eastern side of the Padanilam. It was also disclosed that there was a large reservoir at the center of the vast ground on which the temple stands, (which was now known as Kallukettuchira), and which is outside the temple compound today.\n",

The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. While the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla is considered the original seat of the deity (\"Moolasthanam\"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar.\nThe principal deity Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu) is enshrined in the \"Anantha Shayana\" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the infinite serpent Adi Shesha. Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the trustee of the temple.\n",

The temple is regarded as one of the existing 108 ancient Shiva Temples of ancient Kerala. It also has a prominent place amongst the numerous Shiva temples in South India. It had the tallest shikhara amongst the temples of its time. The Rajarajeshwara temple has a top of about 90 tonnes. If any problem is encountered in the other temples of South India, devotees seek a solution in this temple through a prasna, a traditional method of astrological decision making. The prasna is conducted on a peedha (a raised platform) outside the temple.\nLegendarily, it was supposedly renovated by Sage Parashurama, long before the Kali Yuga commenced. Several centuries ago it was renovated by the Mushika (Kolathiri) dynasty kings. This temple was rebuilt into its present form in the early eleventh century. The quadrangular sanctum has a two-tiered pyramidal roof; in front of the sanctum is the namaskara mandapam, but the temple has no kodi maram (flagstaff), unlike others in Kerala. Non-Hindus are not permitted to enter.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "\nThe Sabarimala Temple (Malayalam: \u0d36\u0d2c\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d32) is a temple complex located at Sabarimala hill inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Perinad Village, Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India. It is one of the largest annual pilgrimage sites in the world with an estimate of over 40 to 50 million devotees visiting every year. The temple is dedicated to a Hindu Brahmachari (Celibate) deity Ayyappan also known as Dharma Shasta, who according to belief is the son of Shiva and Mohini, the feminine incarnation of Vishnu. The traditions of Sabarimala are a confluence of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and other \u015arama\u1e47a traditions.\nThe temple is situated on a hilltop amidst eighteen hills at an altitude of 1260\u00a0m (4,134\u00a0ft) above sea level, and is surrounded by mountains and dense forests. The dense forest, part of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, around the temple is known as Poongavanam. Temples exist in each of the hills surrounding Sabarimala. While functional and intact temples exist at many places in the surrounding areas like Nilakkal, Kalaketty, and Karimalai, remnants of old temples survive to this day on remaining hills.\nAnother interesting fact is that more hindus offer prayer at a mosque of Vavar believed to be a muslim devotee of ayappan.\nIn response to a PIL filed in 1991, the Kerala High Court had judged that the restriction of entry of women ages 10\u201350 to the temple was in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial, and it directed the Devaswom Board to uphold the customary traditions of the temple and also concluded that \"since there is no restriction between one section and another section or between one class and another class among the Hindus in the matter of entry to a temple (Sabarimalai) whereas the prohibition is only in respect of women of a particular age group and not women as a class.\"However, On 28 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India, in a 4-1 majority decision (4 men and 1 woman judicial panel), overturned the ban on the entry of women. But the lone woman judge, Indu Malhotra noted in her dissenting judgement that \"what constitutes an essential religious practice is for the religious community to decide\" and not a matter that should be decided by the courts. She added that \"notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion by courts\". The Chief Justice, Dipak Misra, stated that the selective ban on women was not an \"essential part\" of Hinduism, and instead a form of \"religious patriarchy\". Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud stated that the ban \"stigamatises\" and \"stereotypes\" women, while \"placing the burden of men's celibacy\" on them. After supreme court verdict, the southern state of Kerala had witnessed huge violent protest and mass rally's by devotees and some right wing hinduist activists. Devotees have filed around 65 review petition against 28 September 2018 order. Normally Supreme Court of India will never accept review petition against it own order. However considering the facts and circumstance of the matter, Supreme Court has accepted the review petition and decided to hear the proceeding in an open court. After Completion of the hearing in February 2019, the Court ordered under the new Chief Justice Mr. Ranjan Gagoi, to refer the matter to big bench comprising 7 judges to re-consider the decision of 28 September 2018.\nThe temple is open for worship only during the days of Mandalapooja (approximately 15 November to 26 December), Makaravilakku or \"Makara Sankranti\" (14 January) and Maha Thirumal Sankranti (14 April), and the first five days of each Malayalam month.\n",

The main one is the Vrishchikoltsawam, which is conducted every year in the month of Vrishchikam (November\u2013December), kicking off the 'Ulsava' Season in Kerala. And this Vrishchikolsavam is the biggest temple festival in the world  followed by the koodalmanikyam ulsavam iringalakkuda ( Thrissur pooram is not an utsavam but it is a pooram so not counted as utsavam )   and one of the biggest major festivals in the world. \nThe deity in this temple is Lord Vishnu who is in the form of Santhanagopala Murthy. It is well believed that childless couples will be blessed with children on praying Poornathrayesan.Offering kanikka(which means money offerd to lord )to poornathrayeesa  in the most pure  gold pot on thrikketta purappadu day (fourth day of vrishchikotsavam) is the greatest achievement that a devotee can achieve. Visiting poornathrayeesa who is present on top of 15 elephants during the grant procession of vrishchikotsavam is also  considered to be an achievement of a devotee. Lord poornathrayeesa is considered to be the greatest lover of elephants and he is fond of elephants.\n",

It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to god Vishnu, who is worshipped as Navamukunda Perumal at Tirunavaya. The temple has no pond or well, and water from the river is used for all rituals.  The presence of Cherutirunavaya Brahma - Siva Temples across the River Ponnani at Tavanur makes it a Trimurti sangama. The river bank in the temple are considered as holy as Kasi and the ritual offering practices for forefathers (bali tarpana/sradha puja) are similar to the ones done there. Ganapati (Adi Ganesa/Gajendra), Lakshmi (\"Malarmangai Nachiyar\") and Ayyappa Swami are the associated pratishthas. Goddess Lakshmi has a separate sri kovil in the temple, unlike most of the other Narayana-Lakshmi temples.\nThe temple was the venue of the Mamankams, a festival celebrated once in 12 years from at least the 8th century AD. The temple building was attacked and destroyed during the invasion of Kerala by Sultan of Mysore Tipu (18th century AD), and later attacked in 1921 during the Mappila Rebellion. The present temple building is constructed in the indigenous Kerala Temple Architecture style.\nPresently, the Tirunavaya temple (Malappuram Division, Grade: Sp) is administered by Samutiri of Kozhikode (Zamorin of Calicut) as the managing trustee under Malabar Devaswom Board, Government of Kerala. The temple is open from 05.00 am to 10.00 am and 04.00 pm to 07.00 pm on all days leaving festive days.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "Pashupatinath Temple at Mandsaur, also referred to as the Mandasor Shiva temple, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, India. It belongs to Pashupatinath tradition which is one of 6 major tradition within Shaivism. It is located on Shivna River, and is known for its eight-faced Shiva Linga. The temple sculpture is dated to the 5th or 6th century based on inscriptions, with some referring to the site as Dashapura. It is near the Rajasthan border in the historic region of Malwa, about 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi) from Indore, about 340 kilometres (210\u00a0mi) west of Udaigiri Caves and about 220 kilometres (140\u00a0mi) east of Shamalaji ancient sites, both a significant source of Gupta Empire era archaeological discoveries. The site has been important to dating and the architectural studies of some distant sites such as the Elephanta Caves.\nThe site's history is traceable to the 2nd-century CE when it was already a Hindu pilgrimage site. It is mentioned by the ancient Indian poet Kalidasa, who praises the women of Dashapura as \"so practiced in their seductive movements\". Ten inscriptions found in the area suggest the Mandasor site was an important cultural and religious center in the first half of the 1st millennium CE. Nine of these inscriptions are Sanskrit poems, most dated between 404 and 487 CE, and all include invocations to Hindu gods such as Vasudeva and Shiva in various forms. They mention kings of Gupta Empire era, as well as temples of Dashapura. Together with dozens of temples discovered at a number of sites in western Madhya Pradesh, eastern Rajasthan and northern Gujarat region, the Mandasor site with the Shiva Stele and the temple reflect what Stella Kramrisch called one of the \"Western schools\" of ancient and early medieval Indian art. James Harle concurs and includes the nearby Sondni and Kilchipura sites to the Western school along with regions farther west. According to Harle, the sculpture from the temple and other archaeological findings such as the Mandasor inscriptions \u2013 one of which he calls \"the longest and certainly the most beautiful of the Gupta inscriptions\" \u2013 reflect the \"flavor of life at its best in Gupta times\".\nThe inscriptions, state Harle and other scholars, suggest that the sculpture and temples of Mandasor were built with resources pooled by the common people, such as silk weavers of Dashapura (Mandasor) who had settled there from Gujarat. However, these inscriptions mention a Surya (Sun) temple, a Vishnu temple and others. They do not mention the Pashupatinath temple. Excavations have yielded several brick temples of Shiva which have been dated to the 6th century, suggesting that Shiva was a prominent deity along with others in ancient Mandasor. Additionally, only the foundations of most early temples and monuments are presently identifiable, as the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temples in Mandasor were demolished and its stones and relief panels used to build a Muslim fort after the region was conquered in the late medieval era.\nThe eight face Shiva found in the reconstructed Pashupatinath temple is from the 1st millennium CE and a rare iconography. It is 4.5 metres (15\u00a0ft) tall and was discovered in the river bed of the Shivana. It has been reconsecrated into the temple. The upper part of the linga has four heads in a line, while the other four heads are carved below them in the second line. The faces have open eyes, with the third eye on their forehead visible. Each face has elaborate hair probably reflecting the culture of its time for men. Each wears jewelry such as earlobes, necklace and more. The eight faces represent the various aspects of Shiva in regional Shaivism theology: Bhava, Pashupati, Mahadeva, Isana, Rudra, Sharva, Ugra and Asani. It is sometimes referred to as Ashtamukha or Ashtamurti. According to Goyala, this Mandasor linga is likely from the early 6th century.\n",

Of these, the small but important and ancient Kankali Devi Temple is in good condition, and is usually dated to about 400-425 CE.  Unless another building is mentioned, references to \"the temple\" below refer to this.  \nAlso referred to as Tigowa or Tigwan, the site is about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) north of Bahuriband between Katni and Jabalpur. The Hindu temple ruins were badly damaged during a colonial era railway project when a contractor demolished and excavated the ruins as building material for the railway project.\nOf the monuments, the Kankali Devi Temple is most notable and is a Gupta period temple. It is one of the oldest surviving Hindu temples, illustrating the formative stages of Hindu temple architecture and the essential elements found in the north Indian style through the modern era. It has a sanctum and an open portico supported on four pillars. The sides of the portico were filled in with walls containing panels at a later period.  The sanctuary is, and always was, covered with a flat roof, and is generally very similar to the Gupta period Temple 17 at Sanchi.\nDespite its name, the temple was probably dedicated to Vishnu, with other elements added later.  An image of him as Narasimha is placed inside the sanctum. The portico has an image of the Sheshashai Vishnu (Narayana) and another one of Chamunda (Kankali Devi). Projecting from the front of the portico is a later relief of a seated Vishnu in the yoga asana position with a serpent hood above the head.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "Sasbahu Temple, also called the Sas-Bahu Mandir, Sas-Bahu Temples, Sahasrabahu Temple or Harisadanam temple, is an 11th-century twin temple in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India. Near the Gwalior Fort and dedicated to Vishnu in his Padmanabha form, like most Hindu and Jain temples in this region, it is mostly in ruins and was badly damaged from numerous invasions and Hindu-Muslim wars in the region. It was built in 1093 by King Mahipala of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty, according to an inscription found in the larger of the twin temple. The twin temples are situated in the Gwalior Fort.\nThe temple's tower and sanctum has been destroyed, but its architecture and damaged carvings can still be appreciated from the ruins. The jagati platform is 100 feet (30\u00a0m) long and 63 feet (19\u00a0m) wide, on a square plan. The temple was three-storeyed, which was one of its distinguishing features and sophistication. It followed a central cluster concept, states Adam Hardy. The surviving elements of the temple are the entrance porch and the mandapa. According to James Harle, though the prasada (tower, spire) no longer exists, the triple storey plan with a cruciform foundation and balconies suggests that it had a North Indian Bhumija style architecture. This style, states Harle, is marked by a well proportioned superstructure, its \"regularly arranged little subordinate sikharas strung out like gigantic beaded garlands\".\nThis temple mainly has three entrances from three different directions. In the fourth direction, there is a room which is currently closed. The entire temple is covered with carvings, notably 4 idols of Brahma, Vishnu and Saraswati above its entrance door. The pillar carvings show Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism related carvings. The larger temple ornamentation covers all the exterior walls and all surviving interior surfaces.\nThe twin temple, like elsewhere in India, has locally been called Sasbahu temple. The word Sasbahu means \"mother-in-law, bride\" or \"a mother with her daughter-in-law\", an association that implies their being together and interdependent. The Sas temple is typically the larger older temple of the twin. The Gwalior Sasbahu temple follows this style, but both temples are dedicated to Vishnu. Only the Sas temple has survived in some form, the Bahu temple is a shell structure of the original one storey with a highly ornate door frame and its defaced wall reliefs surviving. The remnants of the Bahu temple at Gwalior suggest that it may have been a smaller version of the Saas temple.\nThe Sas temple has a square sanctum attached to a rectangular two storey antarala and a closed three storey mandapa with three entrances. The temple main entrance porch has four carved Ruchaka ghatapallava-style pillars that are load-bearing. The walls and lintels are intricately carved, though much defaced. On the lintel of the entrances, friezes of Krishna-leela scenes are carved inside, while the outer side narrate legends from other Hindu texts. Above the lintel is Garuda, the vahana of Vishnu.\nThe Bahu temple also has a square sanctum with 9.33 feet (2.84\u00a0m) side, with four central pillars. Its maha-mandapa is also a square with 23.33 feet (7.11\u00a0m) side, with twelve pillars. The temple, like most Malwa and Rajputana historic temples, provides multiple entrances to the devotee. The roof consists of two rotated squares that intersect to form an octagon capped by successive overlapping circles. The pillars have octagonal bases as well, with girls carved but these have been defaced and mutilated. The sanctum has an image of damaged Vishnu, next to whom stands Brahma holding the Vedas on one side and Shiva holding the trident on the other side.\n",

The word Ghrneshwara means \"lord of compassion\". The temple is an important pilgrimage site in the Shaiva tradition of Hinduism, which considers it as the last or twelfth Jyotirlinga (linga of light). This pilgrimage site is located in Ellora (also called Verul), less than a kilometer from Ellora Caves \u2013 a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 30 kilometres (19 miles) north-west of the city of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles) east-northeast from Mumbai.\nThe temple structure was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate in 13th and 14th-century. The temple went through several rounds of rebuilding followed by re-destruction during the Mughal-Maratha conflict. It was rebuilt in the current form in the 18th century under the sponsorship of queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, after the fall of the Mughal Empire. It is presently an important and active pilgrimage site of the Hindus and attracts long lines of devotees daily. Anyone can enter the temple premises and its inner chambers, but to enter the sanctum sanctorum core (garbha-ghrya) of the temple, the local Hindu tradition demands that men must go bare-chested.\nThe Grishneswar temple is an illustration of maratha temple architectural style and structure. The temple, built of red rocks, is composed of a five-tier shikara. The temple was re-constructed by Maloji Bhosale of Verul, (grandfather of Shivaji) in the 16th century and later again by queen Ahilyabai Holkar in the 18th century. She is credited with rebuilding some of major Hindu temples such as the Kashi Vishvanath temple in Varanasi, a Vishnu temple in Gaya, and a much larger Shiva Jyotirlinga temple in Somnath Temple.\nThis 240\u00a0ft x 185\u00a0ft temple is the smallest Jyotirlinga temple in India. Halfway up the temple, Dashavataras of Vishnu are carved in red stone. A court hall is built on 24 pillars. On these pillars, there are carvings summarizing various legends and mythologies of Shiva. The Garbhagriha measures 17\u00a0ft x 17\u00a0ft. The Lingamurty faces eastward. There is a Nandi bull in the court hall. Ghrishneshwar Temple is a revered temple, situated in the state of Maharashtra. The temple houses carvings and sculptures of many Hindu gods and goddesses.\n",

While Hindu sects devoted to the goddess Mumbadevi are attested to as far back as the 15th century, it is said that the temple was built in 1675 near the main landing site of the former Bori Bunder creek against the north wall of the English Fort Saint George by a Hindu woman also named Mumba. The creek and fort are now deteriorated to a point at which they are but derelict reminders of the city's past. The temple, on the other hand, is still active.\nThe goddess Mumba was patron of the Marathi-speaking agris (salt collectors) and kolis (fisherfolk), the original inhabitants of the Seven Islands of Bombay. She is depicted as a black stone sculpture in the temple. An etymology of Mumba that is popular is \"Maha Amba,\" or \"Great Mother,\" one of the many of India's more well-known names for the Hindu Mother Goddess (Devi). Located in Bhuleshwar area in South Mumbai, the temple is in the heart of the steel and clothing markets. It is a sacred pilgrimage spot and place of worship for Hindus and is thus visited daily by hundreds of people. It is not uncommon for visitors of Mumbai to pay their respects at the temple and is one of the tourist attractions of Mumbai.\n",

The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, first of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.\nThe Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. These gave their name to the English term 'Juggernaut'. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or nineteen years by an exact replica. It is one of the Char Dham.\nThe temple is sacred to all Hindus and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great Vaishnava saints, such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were closely associated with the temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and Adi Shankaracharya established the Govardhana Mutt, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism whose founder Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "Konark Sun Temple (Konark Surya Mandir) is a 13th-century CE (year 1250) Sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) northeast from Puri on the coastline of Odisha, India. The temple is attributed to king Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty about 1250\u00a0CE.\nDedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30\u00a0m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61\u00a0m) high, much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga Architecture.\nThe cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and still remains a source of controversy. Theories range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th and 17th centuries. This temple was called the \"Black Pagoda\" in European sailor accounts as early as 1676 because it looked a great tower which appeared black. Similarly, the Jagannath Temple in Puri was called the \"White Pagoda\". Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984, it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February.\nKonark Sun Temple is depicted on the reverse side of the Indian currency note of Rs 10 to signify its importance to Indian cultural heritage.\n",

The temple is the most prominent landmark of Bhubaneswar city and one of the major tourist attractions of the state.\nThe Lingaraja temple is the largest temple in Bhubaneswar. The central tower of the temple is 180\u00a0ft (55\u00a0m) tall. The temple represents the quintessence of the Kalinga architecture and culminating the medieval stages of the architectural tradition at Bhubaneswar. The temple is believed to be built by the kings from the Somavamsi dynasty, with later additions from the Ganga rulers. The temple is built in the Deula style that has four components namely, vimana (structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana (assembly hall), natamandira (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings), each increasing in the height to its predecessor. The temple complex has 50 other shrines and is enclosed by a large compound wall.\nBhubaneswar is called the Ekamra Kshetra as the deity of Lingaraja was originally under a mango tree (Ekamra) as noted in Ekamra Purana, a 13th-century Sanskrit treatise. The temple is active in worship practises, unlike most other temples in Bhubaneswar and Shiva is worshipped as Harihara, a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva. The temple has images of Vishnu, possibly because of the rising prominence of Jagannath sect emanating from the Ganga rulers who built the Jagannath Temple in Puri in the 12th century. The central deity of the temple, Lingaraja, is worshipped both as Shiva and Vishnu. The harmony between the two sects of Hinduism, Shaivism, and Vaishnavism, is seen in this temple where the deity is worshipped as Harihara, a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva.\nLingaraja temple is maintained by the Temple Trust Board and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The temple has an average of 6,000 visitors per day and receives lakhs of visitors during festivals. Shivaratri festival is the major festival celebrated in the temple and event during 2012 witnessed 200,000 visitors.  The temple compound is not open to non-Hindus, but there is a viewing platform beside the wall offering a good view of the main exteriors.  This was originally erected for a visit by Lord Curzon when Viceroy.\n",

The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the oldest existing temples in the state.  It is believed to have been built around 650 CE in Nagara style and has all the main features of the pre-10th century Kalinga Architecture style temples. The temple is one among the Parashurameshvara group of temples.\nParashurameshvara Temple has a vimana, the sanctum, and a bada, the curvilinear spire over its roof, rising to a height of 40.25\u00a0ft (12.27\u00a0m). It is the first temple to have an additional structure called jagamohana, compared to the earlier temples that had only the vimana. Though the temple is dedicated to Shiva, it contains sculpted images of Shakta deities, which are otherwise normally part of Shakta temples. The temple is the first in Bhubaneswar to contain depictions of Saptamatrikas, namely, Chamunda, Varahi, Indrani, Vaishnavi, Kaumari, Shivani and Brahmi. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument. Parashurashtami is the major festival celebrated in the temple during June\u2013July every year. The temple is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the state of Odisha.\n",

Shree Shree Samleswari, the presiding deity of Sambalpur, is a strong religious force in western part of Odisha and Chhattisgarh state of India. On the bank of the river Mahanadi the mother goddess Samleswari is worshipped from ancient times as Jagatjanani, Adishakti, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati, and is the mother of the universe. The region in which the temple is situated has a rich cultural heritage. Sambalpur region is popularly known as Hirakhand from ancient times. Ptolemy has described the place as Sambalak, according to Tavernir, the French explorer, and Edward Gibbon, the English historian, diamonds were exported to Rome from Sambalpur.\nThe temple is of Sandhara order (These types of the temples have a square sanctum enclosed by a gallery of pillars meant for Pradakshina). Thus, the Sandhara temples have a Pradakshinapatha is built of a kind of stone durable as granite, cemented with lime mortar, the whole building is plastered, but in the course of time the surface has become mouldy. The temple comprises two separate structures. The square sanctum  sanctorum enshrining the deity is four step below the 10-foot-wide (3.0\u00a0m) covered circumambulation, which is supported by 12 stone pillars. Eleven parswa devis (side Goddess), are embedded on the outer wall of the sanctum, so that the devotees can worship those deities during parikrama through the vaulted circumambulation. The Idol of Shree Shree Samlei Devi consists of a large block of Granite rock with an inverted, trunk like projection at the bottom. The devi's idol inspires sublime sentiments of awe, fear, reverence, devotion, love and affection towards all-pervading motherhood.\nShe is worshiped with a great care and devotion by the natives in her temple, famously known as the samleswari temple. Among the varieties of festivals observed before the goddess throughout the year three festivals are observed prominently. The first two are navaratri puja during the months of March and April and during the months of September and October. The goddess is dressed differently each day representing each of the navadurgas, this is called Beeja. Among these two Navaratri pujas (nine days continuous worship of the goddess) the second one is observed with a great splendour and devotion. The third festival which is said to be the chief festival of the whole western Odisha  region is Nuakhai. In this festival, the farmers offer the first produce from their lands to the goddess before using it for their use.\n",

It is located in Pillayarpatti village in  Tiruppathur Taluk, Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu, India.\nThe temple is dedicated to Karpaka Vinayakar (Ganesha). In the cave temple, there are rock cut images of Ganesha, Siva linga and another carving that has been variously identified as Ardhanarishwara or Harihara or the early king between them who built this temple. All these are notable for their unusual iconography. In late 19th-century, during restorative excavation and repair work, panchaloga statues were discovered. These are dated to the 11th-century.\nThe temple has several inscriptions within the rock-cut shrines, as well as on the walls and mandapam outside. One of them mentions \"Desi vinayakar\" and also helps date the core layer of this temple to the 7th-century Ganesha. Another notable inscription in the sanctum is more archaic, sharing paleographic features of Tamil Brahmi and early Vatteluttu. This has led to proposals that portions of this Ganesha temple are likely older by a few centuries. The temple walls and mandapams have additional stone inscriptions from the 11th to 13th-century.\nThe temple is one of the nine ancestral Hindu temples of the Chettiars, its importance established in their tradition in Kali year 3815 (714 CE). The temple has a large colorful gopuram, with large mandapams elaborately decorated with frescoes, many shrines inside, salas originally added for dance and hymns singing, temple kitchen, an architecture that follows the Agamic texts and Shilpa Sastras, and a large temple tank to its north. Most of these were added in later centuries to the core rock-cut cave shrine. The temple is active and attracts numerous pilgrims, particularly women, on the annual festivals and chariot processions such as on Vinayaka Chaturthi and the Brahmothsavam in the Tamil month of Vaikasi.\n",

Palani temple is considered synonymous with Panchamritam, a sweet mixture made of five ingredients.\nAs per Hindu legendary beliefs, Sage Narada visited the celestial court of Shiva at Mount Kailash to present to him a fruit, the gnana-palam (literally, the fruit of knowledge). He decided to award it to whichever of his two sons who first encircle the world thrice. Accepting the challenge, Murugan (Karthikeya) started his journey around the globe on his mount peacock. However, Ganesha, who surmised that the world was no more than his parents Shiva and Shakti combined, circumambulated them and won the fruit. Murugan was furious and felt the need to get matured from boyhood and hence chose to remain as a hermit in Palani. The idol of the Muruga in Palani was created and consecrated by sage Bogar, one of Hinduism's eighteen great siddhaars, out of an amalgam of nine poisonous herbs or Navapashanam.\nOther than the steps and sliding elephant way, there is a winch and rope car service used for transportation of devotees uphill.

It is significant to the Hindu sect of Saivism as one of the temples associated with the five elements, the Pancha Bhoota Stalas, and specifically the element of fire, or Agni.  \nShiva is worshiped as Arunachalesvara or Annamalaiyar, and is represented by the lingam, with his idol referred to as Agni lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Unnamalai Amman. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The 9th century Saiva saint poet Manikkavasagar composed the Tiruvempaavai here.\nThe temple complex covers 10 hectares, and is one of the largest in India. It houses four gateway towers known as gopurams.  The tallest is the eastern tower, with 11 stories and a height of 66 metres (217\u00a0ft), making it one of the tallest temple towers in India built by sevappa nayakkar (Nayakar dynasty) The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Arunachalesvara and Unnamalai Amman being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls; the most notable is the thousand-pillared hall built during the Vijayanagar period.\nThe present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Vijayanagara rulers of the Sangama Dynasty (1336\u20131485 CE), the Saluva Dynasty and the Tuluva Dynasty (1491\u20131570 CE).

The temple has mythical roots and a Shiva shrine existed at the site when the town was known as Thillai. Chidambaram, the name of the city and the temple literally means \"atmosphere of wisdom\" or \"clothed in thought\", the temple architecture symbolizes the connection between the arts and spirituality, creative activity and the divine. The temple wall carvings display all the 108 karanas from the Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni, and these postures form a foundation of Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance.\nThe present temple was built in the 10th century when Chidambaram was the capital of the Chola dynasty, making it one of the oldest surviving active temple complexes in South India. After its 10th-century consecration by the Cholas who considered Nataraja as their family deity, the temple has been damaged, repaired, renovated and expanded through the 2nd millennium. Most of the temple's surviving plan, architecture and structure is from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with later additions in similar style. While Shiva as Nataraja is the primary deity of the temple, it reverentially presents major themes from Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and other traditions of Hinduism. The Chidambaram temple complex, for example, has the earliest known Amman or Devi temple in South India, a pre-13th-century Surya shrine with chariot, shrines for Ganesha, Murugan and Vishnu, one of the earliest known Shiva Ganga sacred pool, large mandapas for the convenience of pilgrims (choultry, ambalam or sabha) and other monuments. Shiva himself is presented as the Nataraja performing the Ananda Tandava (\"Dance of Delight\") in the golden hall of the shrine Pon Ambalam.\nThe temple is one of the five elemental lingas in the Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, and considered the subtlest of all Shiva temples (Kovil) in Hinduism. It is also a site for performance arts, including the annual Natyanjali dance festival on Maha Shivaratri.\n",

Constructed in the Dravidian architectural style, the temple is glorified by Alvars in their Divya Prabhanda and has the unique distinction of being the foremost among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu.\nThe Place Srirangpatna had the name of the Srirangapuri in the early ages later it got the name of the Srirangapatna. The town is an island being surrounded by the river Cauvery. In this town, there is the temple of Sri Ranganatha. Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, Sri Gangadereshwara, Sri Jyothirmaheshwara and other small temples. Among them, the main temple is that of Sri Ranganatha. The inner apartment of SriRanganatha temple was built in 817 CE by a lady by name Hambi, of the class of dancers in the year 894 CE.\nIt is one of the most illustrious Vaishnava temples in South India rich in legend and history. The temple has played an important role in Vaishnavism history starting with the 11th-century career of Ramanuja and his predecessors Nathamuni and Yamunacharya in Srirangam. Its location, on an island between the Kollidam and Kaveri rivers, has rendered it vulnerable to flooding as well as the rampaging of invading armies which repeatedly commandeered the site for military encampment. The temple was looted and destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate armies in a broad plunder raid on various cities of the Pandyan kingdom in early 14th century. The temple was rebuilt in late 14th century, the site fortified and expanded with many more gopurams in the 16th and 17th centuries. It was one of the hubs of early Bhakti movement with a devotional singing and dance tradition, but this tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way much later.\nThe temple occupies an area of 155 acres (63\u00a0ha) with 81 shrines, 21 towers, 39 pavilions, and many water tanks integrated into the complex making it the world's largest functioning Hindu temple. The temple town is a significant archaeological and epigraphical site, providing a historic window into the early and mid medieval South Indian society and culture. Numerous inscriptions suggest that this Hindu temple served not only as a spiritual center, but also a major economic and charitable institution that operated education and hospital facilities, ran a free kitchen, and financed regional infrastructure projects from the gifts and donations it received.\nThe Srirangam temple is the largest temple compound in India and one of the largest religious complexes in the world. Some of these structures have been renovated, expanded and rebuilt over the centuries as a living temple. The latest addition is the outer tower that is 67 metres (220\u00a0ft) tall, completed in 1987. Srirangam temple is often listed as one of the largest functioning Hindu temple in the world, the still larger Angkor Wat being the largest existing temple. The temple is an active Hindu house of worship and follows Thenkalai tradition of Sri Vaishnavism. The annual 21-day festival conducted during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December\u2013January) attracts 1 million visitors. The temple complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is in UNESCO's tentative list.\n",

Roughly Every village in the Kongu region of Tamil Nadu has a Mariamman temple.\n\nwitnessed the wonderful sight of tigers and cows quenching of the river. Cowherds used to drive the cattle to the fields jeer for grazing. The cows fed on the grass found in plenty here. These cows were driven back to the stables at dusk. The cowherds used to milk each cow and hand over the collected Milk to the owners of the cows. One particular cow did not allow the cowherd to get milk, nor did it allow its calf to go near it.\nAround 300 years ago, the dana Nayakkan or Dhandanyakkan forest was called \"Bannari\". This name Bannari for this great historical place originated because of the great temple \"Bannari Amman Temple\".\nThe cowherd has his own doubts about that particular cow and he decided to have an eye on it. He allowed the other cows to graze and pursued that particular cow secretly. It went alone near a Vengai tree and stood beneath it. Milk began to flow from its udder automatically. He wondered at such a strangle sight and told about it to the other cowherds.\nThe news spread like wildfire to the villagers. Next day they were on the spot to witness the wonder. They found the cow repeating the same behavior. Milk cozed out of the teats of its udder on the particular spot amidst the grass. They removed the thickly grown grass and shrubs there and, to their surprise, they found a sand-hill and s Swayambu Linga near it. Linga is a special of divinity and so they felt that the spot beneath the Vengai tree should have a celestial significance. They prayed to the Linga with fold hands. Among the devotees who were there, one got into a trance. As a spokesman of the Deity he began to pass on the divine message to everybody. According to his words, it was understood that the deity safeguarded the traders from Tamil Nadu who passed by that way to Mysore to sell their goods carried by cows on their back.\nThe deity was enamoured of the picturesque beauty of that place and she decided to stay on there to bless and protect the pilgrims. Moreover, she wanted a temple to be constructed there so that the people in and around that place would pray to Her in the name of Bannari Mariamman. Thus Bannari became the permanent abode of the goddess.\nThe above history has been represented by a set of paintings on the temple wall.\n",

    "detailedDescription": "The Sri Sita Ramachandraswamy temple is a South Indian Hindu temple dedicated to Rama, the seventh incarnation of the god Vishnu. It is located on the shores of the Godavari River in the town of Bhadrachalam, a part of the Bhadradri Kothagudem district in Telangana state. Often simply referred to as Bhadrachalam or Bhadradri, the temple is considered one of the Divya Kshetrams of Godavari and is also revered as Dakshina Ayodhya. According to the legend, Vishnu appeared to Meru's son Bhadra as Rama to answer the latter's prayers. However, Vishnu forgot that Rama was a mortal human and appeared as Vaikuntha Rama with four hands. Sita and Lakshmana form part of the temple's moolavar.\nThe self-manifested moolavirat was discovered in the 17th\u00a0century by Pokala Dhammakka, a tribal woman living in Bhadrareddypalem. After she built a mandapam for the idols, Bhadrachalam's tehsildar Kancherla Gopanna constructed this temple during the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. After Gopanna, Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu and Varada Ramadasu looked after the temple's rituals. Bhadrachalam follows the Vaishnavite Pancharatra Agama tradition, and its system of worship is modelled on that of the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. The temple has four entrances; the Rajagopuram is located at the northern entrance, which is called the Vaikuntha Dwaram. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams.\nBhadrachalam is notable for its principal deity Rama. According to the Brahma Purana, the temple's deity is capable of imparting knowledge to those who worship him. Gopanna used Bhadrachalam as a centre of the Bhajan tradition to spread awareness of the Vaishnavite tradition. The annual Brahmotsavam is the biggest festival celebrated in Bhadrachalam; the key event is the Sri Sitarama Thirukalyana Mahotsavam, or the marriage of Rama and Sita on the eve of Sri Rama Navami. Other important festivals celebrated in Bhadrachalam are Vaikuntha Ekadashi, Vasanthotsavam, and Vijayadashami.\n",

It lies in a valley in Palampet village of Venkatapur Mandal of Mulugu district, a tiny village long past its days of glory in the 13th and 14th centuries. An inscription in the temple dates it to the year 1213 CE and says it was built by a General Recherla Rudra Reddy, during the period of the Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva.\nThe temple is a Sivalayam, where Lord Ramalingeswara is worshipped. Marco Polo, during his visit to the Kakatiya Empire, allegedly called the temple \"the brightest star in the galaxy of temples\". Ramappa Temple stands majestically on a 6\u00a0ft high star-shaped platform. The hall in front of the sanctum has numerous carved pillars that have been positioned to create an effect that combines light and space wonderfully. The temple is named after the sculptor Ramappa, who built it, and is perhaps the only temple in India to be named after a craftsman who built it.\nThe main structure is in a reddish sandstone, but the columns round the outside have large brackets of black basalt which is rich in iron, magnesium and silica.  These are carved as mythical animals or female dancers or musicians, and are \"the masterpieces of Kakatiya art, notable for their delicate carving, sensuous postures and elongated bodies and heads\".\nThe Temple is included in the proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site \"The Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways\", in 2019 on the  \"tentative list\".  The proposal was submitted to UNESCO on 10 September 2010.\n",

They are called Nava-Brahma temples though they are dedicated to Shiva. They exemplify early North Indian Nagara style architecture with cut rock as the building block.\nThe temples are significant for their east-facing simple square plans, intricate carvings of themes of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. They also contain early examples of friezes that narrate legends from Hindu texts such as the Panchatantra fables. The temples were a significant influence on the later era Kakatiya Hindu temples.\nThese temples were built by the Badami Chalukyas rulers, and early eighth century inscriptions found at the site suggest that the site also had a Shaiva matha (Hindu monastery) which has not survived. Their ruins have been restored by the Archaeological Survey of India after 1980.\nThe Alampur Navabrahma temples were badly damaged and defaced during the Islamic invasion of this region in and after the 14th-century. A series of religious wars and conquest led to the construction of an Islamic fort, a mosque and a graveyard called Shah Ali Pedda Dargah being built midst the Navabrahma temples over the 15th to 17th-century. This construction was completed in part using the temple walls and ruined masonry from the temples, according to Ghulam Yazdani \u2013 an archaeologist who surveyed these temples and the Islamic monuments midst these temples in 1926\u201327 for the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Hindus abandoned worship in temples in immediate vicinity of these Sultanate era additions.\n",

It is believed to be one of the holiest Hindu shrines in this part of the country. Popularly known as Matabari, the shrine is set upon a small hillock, since the shape of a hillock resembles the hump of a tortoise (Kurma) and this shape called Kurmap\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101k\u1e5bti is considered the holiest possible site for a Shakti temple, hence also bestowing the name of Kurma P\u012b\u1e6dha. The Goddess is served by traditional Brahmin priests.\nThe temple is considered to be one of the 51 Shakti Peethas; legend says that the little finger of the left leg of Sati fell here. Here, Shakti is worshipped as Tripurasundar\u012b and the accompanying Bhairava is Tripuresh. The main shrine, a cubical edifice with a three-tier roof with a finial, erected by Maharaja of Tripura Dhanya Manikya in 1501 AD, is constructed in the Bengali Ek-ratna style.\nThere are two similar but different sized black stone idols of the Goddess in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. The larger and more prominent idol of 5\u00a0feet height is of Goddess Tripura Sundari and the smaller one, adorably called Chhoto-Ma (literally, Little Mother), is 2\u00a0feet tall and is an idol of Goddess Chandi. Folklore says that the smaller idol was carried by the kings of Tripura to the battlefield.\nEvery year on the occasion of Diwali, a famous Mela takes place near the temple which is visited by more than 0.2 million pilgrims.\n",

'temple of the lord of the field'), is a Hindu temple (shrine) dedicated to Shiva. Located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, Kedarnath is located in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) from Kedarnath temple is carried down to Ukhimath and where the deity is worshiped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.\nThe temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14\u00a0mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is available to reach the structure. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath. The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas. Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any \"major\" damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.\nIt is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, expounded in Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during 6th and 7th century by various saints called Nayanars.

According to \u015ar\u012b Brahma-sa\u1e3fhit\u0101 (verse 5.31), Brahma says the following about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a:\n\"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the flute and jewelled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of \u015ay\u0101masundara is eternally manifest.\" \n",
